- [ ] Staging environment available for testing
- [ ] Production environment secure and stable

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Site is accessible via HTTPS
- ✅ All pages load without errors
- ✅ Forms function correctly
- ✅ Mobile responsive design works
- ✅ No security warnings

3. **Fix the issue** in your code
4. **Redeploy** using Vercel
5. **If critical**: Rollback to previous deployment in Vercel dashboard

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- [ ] Error logs in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] User feedback and bug reports
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Uptime and availability
