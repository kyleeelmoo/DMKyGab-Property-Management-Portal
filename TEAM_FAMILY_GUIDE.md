# Team Family Environment Configuration Guide

This guide provides specific instructions for deploying and configuring the DMKyGab Property Management Portal in a Team Family environment.

## Overview

The Team Family environment is designed for collaborative property management, allowing multiple users (family members, partners, or team members) to access and manage properties together.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Team Roles and Permissions

The portal supports three main user roles:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features, user management, and settings
- **Property Manager**: Access to property and tenant management, maintenance, and financials
- **Tenant**: Limited access to view their own information and submit maintenance requests

### 2. Deployment for Team Access

#### Recommended Hosting: Vercel

Vercel provides:
- ✅ Free HTTPS with automatic SSL
- ✅ Global CDN for fast access worldwide
- ✅ Automatic deployments from Git
- ✅ Environment variable management
- ✅ Easy rollback capabilities

#### Setup Steps

1. **Create Team on Vercel**
   ```
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click on your profile → "Create Team"
   - Name your team (e.g., "Family Property Management")
   - Invite team members with appropriate access levels
   ```

2. **Deploy as Team Project**
   ```
   - Select your team when creating new project
   - Import the repository
   - Configure deployment settings
   - All team members can view deployments
   ```

3. **Environment Variables for Team**
   ```bash
   # Shared across all team members
   APP_ENV=production
   TEAM_NAME=Family Property Management
   
   # Individual API keys (if using backend)
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=xxx
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx
   ```

### 3. Multi-User Access

#### Shared Login Setup

For family/team access, you have two options:

**Option A: Shared Account (Simple)**
- Use a shared email/password
- All family members use the same login
- Pros: Simple, no backend needed
- Cons: No individual tracking

**Option B: Individual Accounts (Recommended)**
- Each family member registers separately
- Requires backend integration for user management
- Pros: Individual permissions, activity tracking
- Cons: Requires backend setup

### 4. Data Isolation (Future Enhancement)

For teams managing multiple properties:

```javascript
// Example property isolation
const userProperties = {
  userId: 'family-123',
  properties: [
    { id: 1, address: '123 Main St', familyMembers: ['user1', 'user2'] },
    { id: 2, address: '456 Oak Ave', familyMembers: ['user1', 'user3'] }
  ]
};
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Password Management

**For Shared Accounts:**
- Use a strong, unique password
- Consider using a password manager (1Password, LastPass)
- Change password quarterly
- Enable 2FA if backend supports it

**For Individual Accounts:**
- Enforce password complexity (already implemented)
- Require periodic password changes
- Implement password reset functionality

### 2. Access Control

```javascript
// Example access control (requires backend)
const permissions = {
  admin: ['view', 'edit', 'delete', 'manage_users'],
  manager: ['view', 'edit', 'maintenance'],
  tenant: ['view', 'submit_maintenance']
};
```

### 3. Secure Communication

- ✅ HTTPS enforced on all deployments
- ✅ Security headers configured
- ✅ XSS protection enabled
- ✅ Content Security Policy ready

## Team Collaboration Features

### Current Features

1. **Shared Dashboard**
   - All family members see the same properties
   - Real-time updates (with page refresh)
   - Unified maintenance tracking

2. **Notification System**
   - Visual notification badge
   - Important updates highlighted
   - (Future: Email/SMS notifications)

3. **Activity Tracking**
   - View recent maintenance requests
   - Track rent payments
   - Monitor lease expirations

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Daily Check-in**
   - Review dashboard for urgent items
   - Check pending maintenance requests
   - Monitor payment deadlines

2. **Weekly Review**
   - Review analytics page
   - Update financial records
   - Plan upcoming maintenance

3. **Monthly Planning**
   - Review lease expirations
   - Financial reconciliation
   - Property maintenance scheduling

## Backend Integration for Teams

To enable full team features, integrate a backend:

### Option 1: Firebase (Recommended for Teams)

```javascript
// Firebase config example
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: "family-property-mgmt.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "family-property-mgmt",
  storageBucket: "family-property-mgmt.appspot.com"
};

// Real-time database for team collaboration
firebase.database().ref('properties').on('value', (snapshot) => {
  updateDashboard(snapshot.val());
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Real-time synchronization
- User authentication built-in
- Scalable and free tier available
- Easy team member management

### Option 2: Supabase (Open Source Alternative)

```javascript
// Supabase config
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY
)

// Team data access
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('properties')
  .select('*')
  .eq('team_id', teamId)
```

**Benefits:**
- Open source
- PostgreSQL database
- Row-level security
- Real-time subscriptions
